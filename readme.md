# Pink Scrape
keeps track of new items listed on the buysell forum of pinkbike because I spend too much time checking it,
sends a windows notification for any new listings.

Put the search URL in the search text file.

First page of results will appear in results.csv

I used the batch file with windows task scheduler to run the program every hour.
I used conda so you will need to change to your conda path or not use conda.
